# React Native from a Junior Developers perspective

My first job as a developer threw me straight into the deep end compared to the technology I was using for my personal projects. I went from quite a few tutorials around working with NextJS, Gatsby, a little bit of NodeJS into the deep-end of a large codebase React Native, a dashboard, serverless functions, and build tools.

For the last couple of months at this job, I felt slightly overwhelmed and daunted by so many new things to learn and work with. I still have a hell of a long way to go, but over the last seven months when looking back, there is a big difference in my knowledge and skill level to when I started.

The main piece I have been covering has been working on the react-native app. It has been a huge learning curve, mainly coming from only really working on web projects previously. These are just some thoughts I have from what I have learned so far.
