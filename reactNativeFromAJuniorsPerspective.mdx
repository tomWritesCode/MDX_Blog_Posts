# React Native from a Junior Developers perspective

My first job as a developer threw me straight into the deep end compared to the technology I was using for my personal projects. I went from quite a few tutorials around working with NextJS, Gatsby and a little bit of NodeJS into the deepend of a large codebase React Native, a dashboard, serverless functions and build tools.

Needless to say for the last couple of months at this job I felt slightly overwhelmed and daunghted by so many new things to learn and work in. I still have a hell of a long way to go, but over the last 7 months when looking back there is a very big difference in my knowledge and skill level to when I started. 

My main piece I have been covering has been working on the react-native app, it has been a huge learning curve mainly coming from only really working on web projects previously and also the size and structure of the app being quite large. These are just some thoughts I have from what I have learnt so far.
