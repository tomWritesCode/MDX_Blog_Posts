# Building a work from home setup.

Building a work from home setup is incredibly fun and also in my eyes essential for working from home professionally. This setup will be agnostic to what laptop / desktop you use in your system, my home setup has both MacOS and Windows.

## Microphone 

Probably one of the biggest improvements you can make to working from home, this is one of the purchaces that is more for anyone you're working with rather than for yourself. Microphones can really range in price and more often than not spending almost any amount of money is better than the micrphone that comes with your laptop/desktop (if it has one at all). 

One thing to consider when purchasing a microphone is how it connects and functions for example a USB microphone more often than not will be a plug and play scenario, whereas an XLR microphone will usually require an interface and depending on the microphone might need one that will provide enough power for the microphone as well.

Some good picks I would recommend looking at would include:

- USB - Rode NT-USB Mini
- 3.5mm - Rode VideoMic NTG (The Mic I own)
- XLR - Rode PodMic

## Headphones (Good headphones)

When looking for headphones when I say good headphones there are two things I would be looking for, audio quality and comfort. You want a set of headphones that sound good because you're going to be using them alot, having said that you will be wanting a comfy set of headphones because...you're going to be using them alot.

Another thing to consider is type of heaaphone, something like the Over ear Sony WH-1000X M3 have great noise cancelation and are really comfy but are quite big. On the other end of the scale is the Fiio FH1s which are a wired in ear style, much smaller and lighter but also cabled. 

My experience with wearing the Sony WH-1000M3 on the entire flight from Sydney to San Francisco and back, comfortable all the way. I also use the Fiio FH1s daily at my office desk through the work day an long into the night of gaming sessions.

## Audio interface

Now that we have our audio in with the microphone and out through our headphones something in the middle will give us a bit of control over our setup. Audio interfaces can have a huge range in features and price, The main thing you should be considering is what microphone is going into the interface and what it needs to power.
